Sample project using [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) to
serve an [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend.

## Overview

This project is a simple starter using Spring Boot with Angular.  The
project relies on a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) multi-module layout to
package both the client and server assets independently (this can also be done
with Gradle if desired).

The Angular client code was initially generated using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
and can be treated as a standard CLI project when developing locally (meaning
using the CLI).  Running the client via `ng serve` is the expected way of
working when doing frontend development.

When running the frontend this way, the [proxy.conf.json](client/proxy.conf.json)
configuration is used to route calls to the backend through to the Spring Boot
application running on port [8080](http://localhost:8080).  This avoids any
issues with [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
and helps reduce compiler "lag" that can interrupt workflow.

To make this seamless, the client pom uses the [frontend maven plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin)
to attach the Angular build to the overall Maven lifecycle.  The result is that
Maven will package the resulting `dist` folder into the client `jar` as static
content.  In addition to build, `lint` and `e2e` scripts are attached to the
Maven `compile` and `integration-test` phases respectively.

When packaged, the resulting Spring Boot executable ['fat' JAR](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-build.html#howto-create-an-executable-jar-with-maven)
will contain the Angular bundles and act as if they had been copied directly
into the `src/main/resources/static` folder.  The client jar may also be used
to transfer and unpack the static bundles to edge cache/CDN (as desired).

## Getting Started

- TODO

### IDE Setup


## Common Problems

### When I run the Spring Boot application in the IDE and visit http://localhost:8080, there is no web content.

When running the application via Spring Boot within the IDE this issue can
occur when there is no `jar` in the client's `target` folder.  The IDE needs
this file in order to add it to the application classpath.  This problem is
frequently the result of a manual `mvn clean`.

To fix this issue, perform a `mvn package` on the client and restart the
application.  NOTE: if you run the frontend via node (usually recommended) and use http://localhost:4200
this problem will not occur.

### IntelliJ doesn't detect the Angular submodule

When you first Import the project if you pick the root pom.xml to import it sometimes does not autodetect
the Angular CLI and doesn't auto configure the server runner.  To work around this, delete the .idea folder
reimport the project just using the root folder. 

## TODO

- Figure out if you can build dev and prod JARs of the client (use Maven scopes?)
- Add UI routing
- Add support for Bootstrap
- Add a sample frontend -> backend call
- Add Spring Data example
- Add Spring Security using OAuth2
- 


`ng new -g --routing --style=scss ng-app`
